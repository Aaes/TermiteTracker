\subsection{Threats to internal validity}
Internal Validity is concerned with confirming that the correlation between the treatment and the outcome is indeed casual, and not accidental, or caused by some third variable that has not been observed. For example we may discover that all programmers in C were faster than programmers in Java, but forget that all the programmers in Java took the experiment very late at night, when they were tired.

\subsection{Threats to external validity}
External validity discusses how far the results are generalizable, or in other words how representative the sample of subjects and the circumstances of the experiment were, to be able to draw general conclusion. Do you expect the same results to be confirmed in somewhat modified conditions?
