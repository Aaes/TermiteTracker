Because time was a limited resource for our team there were features we did not implement and ideas for additional functionality that could have been included. This section describes a short list of the possible extensions to the project we might have worked towards, were we given more time. \\

The first task would be to implement the optional requirements listed in Section \ref{requirements}. While some of these requirements are relatively easy to implement, given the right amount of time, some of them are more challenging. For example tracking multiple ants can be difficult unless all ants are marked, however this is something the current solution cannot solve. \\

When all optional requirements were fulfilled it could be beneficial to support multiple types of XY-plotters. The plotter we used was a little dated and being able to switch to another XY-plotter could be very practical. Of course this would also imply testing with a number of different plotters to see whether or not the same result could be reproduced. To support multiple plotters one could implement plotter control as an external API to make it easy for other applications to control the plotter. \\

One of things we really wanted to do, but did not have the opportunity to, was to test with real termites. The solution was designed to be able to switch between different insects of different sizes and to test with real termites would be a strong indicator of how well this switch would work. \\
