While the project lays the foundation for a fully useable field solution we have chosen to narrow our scope to the essential functionality. This means that the project was designed and tested in a controlled lab environment where factors such as lighting, wind etc. are constant. \\

Because actual termites were out of our reach and that our councillor at Harvard recommended it, we did all of our testing with normal ants instead of termites. We are confident that only minor adjustments, mostly to the blob detection code, are necesarry to make the solution work with termites since the main difference is the size. \\

Painting the ants in different colors can have some impact in the quality of the tracking. As a rule of thumb it is easier to track colors that contrast the background the most. In this project we chose to paint the ants white, red and bright green. We did not try any other colors because we found these to have a high degree of contrast which were sufficient. \\

\todo{sorry, bad excuse ;-)

maybe this is how you felt, but you could have gotten a 3d printer platform and two other cameras from my office. Maybe a bit of discussion about alternatives and then why you decided to use the hardware form Harvard.}

As the HP 7046a plotter was the only hardware available to us we have restricted the project to only include this type of plotter. One could potentially gain better results with a plotter with a finer granularity in coordinates and smoother movement. The cameras supplied with the plotter was also the only cameras available to us and we have therefore also restricted the project to only include these cameras. While one could use higher resolution cameras to obtain a better result, the weight of the camera is also important for the smoothness of the movement of the plotter and must be carefully considered.\\

While it could be intereseting to track several ants we have chosen to focus on tracking a single ant in this project due to time restrictions. Tracking several ants can prove more difficult since one has to account for ants crossing each others paths and would require more time to implement.\\

Our councillor at Harvard wanted the tracking and the interfacing with the tracking device to be implemented in C++ to make it easier for further developement. The graphical user interface was not restricted when choosing programming langauge and we ended up using C\# and Windows Forms to implement it.

\subsubsection{Requirements} \mbox{}\par
\label{requirements}

To ensure the success of the project we compiled a list of the mandatory and optional requirements of the project. This helped us plan our development process and align the expectations between us, our councillor at ITU and our councillor at Harvard University. \\

\noindent \textbf{Mandatory requirements} \par
The mandatory requirements of the project are listed below and must be fulfilled for the project to be considered a success.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Tracking of ants and/or termites using a low resolution camera implemented in C/C++.
    \item The ability to adjust the tracking parameteres before and during the tracking.
    \item Moving the tracking hardware in corresponding to the tracking.
	\item A graphical user interface containing two modes:
    \item - Calibration mode. Must contain a direct feed from the lower camera, a proccessed feed and sliders to adjust the processing.
    \item - Tracking mode. Must contain a direct feed from the lower camera, a direct feed from the overhead camera and statistics.
    \item The ability to collect the following statistics:
    \item - The route of the ant/termite over time. 
    \item - Heatmap of where in the petri dish the ant stay.
    \item The ability to save the collected statistics.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Optional requirements} \par
The optional requirements are the so called "nice-to-have requirements". They are not mandatory for the project but features that could be desirable to implement if the time and resources permits it.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item An additional third mode in the graphical user interface Bias mode: adds the ability to select a certain point which the plotter will try to lure the termites towards using food or pheromones.
    \item The ability to choose certain areas which should be avoided during the tracking.
    \item Collection of these additional statistics:
    \item - Average speed of the ant/termite.
    \item - The amount of ants/termites meet during the tracking. A way to adjust what defines a meeting.
    \item - The amount of time between each meeting. A way to adjust when a meeting starts and ends.
    \item - The duration of each meeting.
    \item - The area of the petri dish covered by the ant/termite. A way to adjust how much area is covered by an ant/termite when stationary (also known as "headsize").
    \item - How much area is covered over time.
    \item - Mean free path (the amount of time between each "stay").
\end{enumerate}

Now that we have established the background, scope and goals for the project we continue with describing the central parts of the project. First we describe how to find the ant/termite in an image, then how we interacted with the plotter and then how we created the graphical user interface.
