\subsection{Something with ants?}
\label{ants}

In this part we had to paint the ants with the paint we bought and we want to give some friendly advice to anyone who wants to do any projects involving ants. If you put them 2-4 minutes in the freezer they become very docile and much easier to paint without harming the ants. When they are taken out they act completely normal after 2-3 minutes. The ants also had a tendency to crawl up the sides of the petri dish. We were recommended to try putting teflon tape (should be really slippery) on the sides without any luck. We were also recommended to try mineral oil but we were unable to get any. Our solution was to place a small petri dish in a bigger petri dish and fill the gap with water. The ants would quickly discover that there was water surronding them which prevented them from escaping the small petri dish. \\
