\subsection{Project Conclusion}

In this report we have presented software for tracking ants and termites in a controlled environment using the OpenCV computer vision framework and an HP 7046A XY-plotter. Additionally we have developed a GUI to control the tracking as well as extract statistics of the ants' and termites' movement. We have tested the software and found that we were unable to track the ant in 31.13\% of the time, and that the tracking works in most cases but still have a small amount of cases where it fails, mostly due to the testing environment. \\

We argue that although the project has potential for further development, it contributes to the field in general and has potential to help biologists analyze the behavior of termites in a more precise way than before. This analysis can in turn help the field of swarm robotics to develop better collaboration algorithms for robots in the future.
