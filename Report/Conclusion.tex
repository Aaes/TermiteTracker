\subsection{Conclusion}

In this report we have presented software for tracking ants and termites in a controlled environment using the OpenCV computer vision framework and a HP 7046a XY-plotter. Additionally we have developed a GUI to control the tracking as well as extract a heatmap of the termites movement and the speed of the termite. We have tested the software and found that the tracking works in most cases but still have a small amount of cases where it fails, mostly due to the testing environment. \\

We argue that although the project has room for further development it contriubutes to the TERMES project in general and has potential to help biologsts analyse the behavior of termites in a more precise way than before. This analysis can in turn help the field of swarm robotics to develop better collaboration algorithms for robots in the future.

%\todo{Remember here to focus on how this has help the work on termite tracking moving forwards as opposed to discussion technical problems of you project.}
