\section{Introduction}

Many species of termites, including ants, work in swarms to build structures that are many times larger than themselves. The fact that they do this in an efficient manner makes termites an interesting subject for study because we, as humans, can hope to be able to learn from their techniques and apply them in a human context in construction of houses, bridges etc. Studying termite behavior, however, requires a lab environment facilitating appropriate hard- and software tools. 

The goal of the Self-Organizing Systems Research Group (SOSRG) at Harvard University is to develop a swarm construction system in which robots cooperate to build 3D structures much larger than themselves. As of this writing, the system consists of simple robots that are able to move around and cooperate in and combining physical objects in order to build larger user defined pieces from high level descriptions. 

This project is conducted at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU) in the fall 2013 in cooperation with SOSRG. The goal of the project is to build software to interface with Harvard hardware in order to create a stand-alone environment for tracking and monitoring ants. Specifically,
