• State the problem - There is no existing software that allows tracking of termites. %using the HP plotter provided by harvard as well as being able to extract relevant statistics.\\
• Say why it’s an interesting problem - It will enable biologists to make better analyses based on more empricial data \\
• Say what your solution achieves - A way to control the plotter that tracks an ant/termite in real time and collects data that can be extracted as statistics\\
• Say what follows from your solution - While this is just a prototype (in a lab enviroment) it is a step towards making new and better field equipment for biologists along with corresponding software.\\
