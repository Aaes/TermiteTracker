%• State the problem - There is no existing software that allows tracking of termites. %using the HP plotter provided by harvard as well as being able to extract relevant statistics.\\
%• Say why it’s an interesting problem - It will enable biologists to make better analyses based on more empricial data \\
%• Say what your solution achieves - A way to control the plotter that tracks an ant/termite in real time and collects data that can be extracted as statistics\\
%• Say what follows from your solution - While this is just a prototype (in a lab enviroment) it is a step towards making new and better field equipment for biologists along with corresponding software.\\

The Self-Organizing Systems Research Lab at Harvard University wants to physically track termites as well as being able to extract relevant statistics about them. At the moment there is no existing software to fulfill this function which is why this project was developed. Tracking termites could enable biologists to investigate how they work together and what behavioral patterns they express. This can in turn help swarm robotics develop better collaboration between robots. \\

This project enables the user to control a XY-plotter and track ants and termites in a controlled enviroment and collect the relevant data. While the solution is just a prototype it provides the foundation for further development towards real field equipment for biologists.
