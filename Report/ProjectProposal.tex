\section{Project Proposal}

%The Self-Organizing System Research Lab on Harvard has created a autonomous robot for tracking African termites in a lab environment. Working with and tracking these termites is cumbersome as they only thrive in environments that resemble their native environment and only when they are together with other termites. Therefore automatic tracking of specific termites is necessary, as tracking up until now has been done manually. Hardware has been created to handle this, however it lacks proper software support. \\

The purpose of this project is to develop software, such that the provided hardware can be used to track these ants/termites and analyze the output, as well as providing basic user input to the robot tracker. \\

There are three parts in this project:  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Tracking termites using a low resolution camera. In order to track a termite, it is necessary to be able to determine its position and move the camera to its new position using image analysis on the camera output. 

\item Interact with the tracking device and update the camera's position with the result from the tracking software. 

\item Design and develop a user interface that can be used by biologists to retrieve statistical data from the tracking.  
\end{enumerate}
